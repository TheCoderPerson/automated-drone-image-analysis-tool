Automated Drone Image Analysis Tool
=============================

The Automated Drone Image Analysis Tool (ADIAT) provides a platform through with algorithm can be used to programmatically identify areas of interest in a set of image  The primary use case for this tool is to aid in the analysis of images taken by UAVs during Search and Rescue Operations.

This tool was developed by Texas Search and Rescue (TEXSAR) as an open source project for the SAR community.

Features
--------

- Leverages Color Detection capabilities provided by OpenCV (https://opencv.org/)
- UI build on QT_ Framework (https://www.qt.io/)
 

Getting started
---------------

First create and activate a vitual environment working development environment
    Create Environment::
    python -m venv <environment name>
    Activate Environment (Windows):: <environment name>\Scripts\activate
    Activate Environment (Mac/Linux):: source <environment name>/bin/activate

From the activated environment, install all dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirement-dev.txt

Once done, you can run the application like this::

    python app

UI Resources
--------------------------

In order to ease the development process, the Qt Creator project ``app.pro`` is
provided. You can open it to edit the UI files or to manage resources.
UI files and resources can be built like this

    python setup.py build_res

Note that this command is automatically run before running ``sdist`` and
``bdist_app`` commands.

Compiled application
--------------------

You can generate a *compiled* application so that end-users do not need to
install anything. You can tweak some settings on the ``app.spec`` file. It can
be generated like this

    python setup.py bdist_app
