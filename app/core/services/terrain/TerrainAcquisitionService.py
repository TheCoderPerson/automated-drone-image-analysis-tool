"""Keep elevation data stocked for the area a project actually covers.

One service for **every** elevation source, one place where the decision to
download is made, and one set of triggers. Before this existed each source
downloaded on its own terms — Terrarium fetched a tile at the moment an AOI
needed it, 3DEP only ever arrived through a dialog the operator had to go
find — so the same operation behaved differently depending on a preference
set weeks earlier.

**Sources are strategies, not branches.** Adding an elevation source means
adding a :class:`_Strategy` and registering its provider id; no caller and
no orchestration code learns about provider kinds
(CLAUDE.md §2.3). Each strategy answers three questions about a bounding
box — how big is the download, is it already covered, and fetch it — and
knows nothing about when or why it was asked.

**Triggers are standardized.** Acquisition is attempted at
:data:`TRIGGER_ANALYSIS` (the network is idle for exactly as long as the
analysis pass keeps the CPU busy), :data:`TRIGGER_VIEWER_OPEN` (the
operator is about to work AOIs that need terrain) and
:data:`TRIGGER_EXPORT` (a report or map is being produced, possibly from a
path that never opened a viewer). The same gates apply at all three, and an
area already attempted in this process is not attempted again, so firing
from several places costs nothing.

**Gates, in order, all from settings:**

1. ``UseTerrainElevation`` off — the operator asked for flat-terrain
   positioning, so no elevation data is wanted at all.
2. ``OfflineOnly`` on — the same floor :class:`TerrainService` honours for
   individual lookups. Never download in offline mode.
3. Nothing to derive an area from, or the area is already covered.
4. Estimated size over ``AutoAcquireTerrainMaxMB``. A download nobody is
   watching must not surprise a metered field connection; an implausible
   bounding box is refused rather than fetched.
5. No connectivity — checked once per process, and only when a download is
   otherwise about to happen.

**Failure is always tolerated.** Terrain sharpens AOI positions; it is not
part of any operation's contract. Nothing here raises, blocks or opens a
dialog: every path returns an :class:`AcquisitionOutcome` carrying the
reason, and callers report it or ignore it.
