"""Run terrain acquisition off the UI thread, from any trigger point.

The one place the app starts a terrain download. Every trigger — an
analysis pass, opening a viewer, running an export — calls
:meth:`TerrainAcquisitionController.ensure` and gets identical behaviour,
because the decision itself lives in
:class:`~core.services.terrain.TerrainAcquisitionService.TerrainAcquisitionService`
and the same gates apply regardless of who asked.

This class adds only what a service must not: a thread, cancellation tied
to the caller's lifetime, and a message for the operator. It knows nothing
about elevation sources.

**Unobtrusive by construction.** Fire-and-forget: no dialog, no modal
progress, no return value the caller has to handle. Callers do not wait,
and a caller that goes away simply cancels. A skip is reported once, in
the message pane, because "terrain got better" and "terrain is unchanged"
are worth telling apart — and the reason (offline, off, over the size
limit) is actionable.
